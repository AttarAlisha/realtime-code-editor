## 🎯 Project Inspiration

This project was inspired during my preparation for online coding interviews. Most companies ask candidates to write code in platforms like Google Docs while screen sharing — which lacks syntax support and real-time interactivity. I wanted a collaborative tool that works like a live whiteboard coding session for interviews, mentorship, and team projects — and that’s how **CodeTogether** came to life.
